# curator
The Curator takes a folder of content and ensures it's on Riff.CC.

## Usage
* Copy ~/.rcc-tools.yml from The Director.

* Place or mount files into $radio_folder/radio.

Files should have this structure:

```
artwork/
    release_name/
        poster.jpg
        thumbnail.jpg
releases/
    release_name/
        mp3_v0/
            release_name/
                song.mp3
                playlist.m3u8
```
